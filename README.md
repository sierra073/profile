I am a Software Engineer at [EducationSuperhighway](https://www.educationsuperhighway.org/) (ESH) and passionate about making data useful. I started as a data analyst at PayPal first out of college, but working at ESH (a tech nonprofit/startup) has allowed me to wear many hats and teach myself full stack development. I mainly code in JavaScript and Python, but I'm always learning!
